# Trainer Booking Functionality - Changes Summary

## Overview

Updated the booking system to allow trainers to book their own gym time slots with different rules than neighbors, rather than having admins create recurring schedules for them.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Validation Updates (`src/app/api/bookings/route.ts`)

#### Validation 5: Time Limits by Role

```typescript
// Neighbors: 7 days in advance
// Trainers: 28 days (4 weeks) in advance
// Admins: No time limit
```

**Before**: Only neighbors had a 7-day limit
**After**:

- Neighbors: 7 days ahead
- Trainers: 28 days (4 weeks) ahead
- Admins: Unlimited

#### Validation 8: Daily Booking Limits

```typescript
// Only neighbors are limited to 1 booking per day
// Trainers and admins can book multiple slots per day
```

**Before**: Unclear or not differentiated
**After**: Explicit comment that trainers and admins can have multiple bookings per day

### 2. Calendar View Updates (`src/components/CalendarView.tsx`)

#### Date Range Calculation

```typescript
const maxDate =
  userRole === 'neighbor'
    ? today.clone().add(7, 'days').endOf('day')
    : userRole === 'trainer'
      ? today.clone().add(28, 'days').endOf('day')
      : today.clone().add(365, 'days').endOf('day');
```

**Before**: Trainers had 365-day range (same as admins)
**After**: Trainers limited to 28 days (4 weeks)

#### Validation Messages

```typescript
const message =
  userRole === 'neighbor'
    ? 'You can only book gym slots up to 7 days in advance.'
    : userRole === 'trainer'
      ? 'You can only book gym slots up to 4 weeks in advance.'
      : 'Invalid date range.';
```

**Before**: Only neighbor-specific messages
**After**: Role-specific messages for neighbors and trainers

#### Calendar Navigation

```typescript
const canNavigateNext = currentDate
  .clone()
  .add(1, navigationUnit)
  .isBefore(maxDate);
```

**Before**: Trainers could navigate freely
**After**: Navigation limited based on role (4 weeks for trainers)

### 3. Task Documentation Updates (`gym_scheduler_tasks.md`)

**Task 4.2**: Revised from "Build Trainer Schedule Creation Form" to "Trainer Booking Functionality"

- Marked as COMPLETED
- Documents trainer-specific booking rules
- Lists all acceptance criteria as completed

**Task 4.3**: Changed from "Implement Recurring Booking Generation" to "NOT APPLICABLE (REMOVED)"

- Explains why recurring bookings are not needed
- Notes that feature can be re-implemented if needed in future

## Testing Checklist

To verify the changes work correctly:

1. **Test as Neighbor**:
   - [ ] Can only book 7 days ahead
   - [ ] Can only create 1 booking per day
   - [ ] Calendar navigation stops at 7 days
   - [ ] Appropriate error messages shown

2. **Test as Trainer**:
   - [ ] Can book 28 days (4 weeks) ahead
   - [ ] Can create multiple bookings per day
   - [ ] Calendar navigation stops at 28 days
   - [ ] Appropriate error messages shown
   - [ ] Can book their own training sessions

3. **Test Overlapping Bookings**:
   - [ ] No one can book an overlapping time slot (regardless of role)
   - [ ] Error message shows when attempting overlap

4. **Test Admin Functionality**:
   - [ ] Can view all user bookings
   - [ ] Can cancel any booking
   - [ ] Can change user roles between neighbor/trainer/admin

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Flexibility**: Trainers control their own schedule
2. **Simplicity**: No need for complex recurring booking logic
3. **Scalability**: Trainers can adjust their availability as needed
4. **User Autonomy**: Trainers are empowered to manage their time

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

If needed, you could add:

- Recurring booking templates for trainers (to make repeated bookings easier)
- Bulk booking interface for trainers
- "Copy last week" functionality
- Export trainer schedule to calendar (iCal format)

## Cleanup

After confirming everything works, you can delete:
